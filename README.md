# spotify-dummy-page
A dummy Spotify page created using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project involves building a mock-up of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to recreate the user interface and basic functionalities of Spotify's main page to showcase my skills in front-end web development.The project utilizes HTML to structure the different sections of the page, CSS to style and layout the elements, and JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features.
This project is my attempt to demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to replicate the visual and interactive aspects of a popular web application.
This is one of my personal favourites. :)
Hope you like it, Happy coding!
